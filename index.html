      <p>
        Hello! My name is Lawrence and I am a computer science major at UNF. I
        am currently a senior in the program, and I intend to graduate this
        coming semester with a minor in mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the president of the
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >Association for Computing Machinery</a
        >
        (ACM) club, and I am the treasurer for UNF's software engineering club.
        As such, my responsibilities include leading practice sessions for
        competitive programming competitions, and working on acquiring funding
        for the clubs.

      <h2 class="hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies outside of school is creating small
        programming projects in whatever language catches my eye. I have made
        small projects in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript,
        and C#, and I have a variety of projects on my personal GitHub. Besides
        programming, I also enjoying going to
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >EDM</a
        >
        concerts and meeting with friends, and that is usually how I spend my
        weekends.
      </p >
      <p>
        Some areas of interests that I have in the field of Computer Science
        include compilers and operating systems. I use Regolith Linux as my
        personal operating system, and I enjoy tinkering around on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank"

        operating systems. I also have a large interest in the field of computer
        networking, and have a Microsoft certification in networking.
